Mall Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised ML)

This project uses K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on income and spending behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups for better business and marketing decisions.

Objective : Group customers with similar characteristics using unsupervised machine learning.

Workflow

1. Data exploration and cleaning
2. Feature selection
3. Elbow Method to find optimal clusters
4. K-Means clustering
5. Visualization and interpretation of customer segments

Key Insights
1.  Clear customer segments emerge based on income and spending score
2.  Identifies high-value customers and targetable groups
3.  Demonstrates how clustering supports data-driven marketing

Tech Stack

Python • Pandas • Scikit-learn • Matplotlib • Seaborn • Jupyter

Mall Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

In this project, I applied unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering) to segment retail customers based on income and spending patterns. The goal was to translate raw customer data into actionable business insights.

What I Did
1.  Cleaned and explored customer demographic and financial data
2.  Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of customer segments
3.  Applied K-Means clustering to identify behavioral patterns
4.  Visualized and interpreted clusters from a business perspective


Business Value

The model identifies groups such as:
1.  High-income high-spenders (premium segment)
2.  High-income low-spenders (marketing opportunity)
3.  Budget-conscious shoppers

This type of segmentation helps businesses improve targeted marketing, customer retention, and revenue strategy.


Skills Demonstrated
1.  Unsupervised machine learning
2.  Customer behavior analysis
3.  Data visualization and storytelling
4.  Translating ML results into business insights

## Tools Used

Python • Pandas • Scikit-learn • Matplotlib • Seaborn
